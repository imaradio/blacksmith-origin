The Salvager Origin, by Radio and TenFlip

It is highly recommended to install [Kullhat's Trims Item Fix texture pack](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/trims_item_fix) and the [CIT Resewn mod](https://modrinth.com/mod/cit-resewn), as this will let you see what trims are on an armour piece in your inventory.
